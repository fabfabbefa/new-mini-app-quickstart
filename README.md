This is a demo Mini App application built using OnchainKit and the Farcaster SDK. Build a waitlist sign-up mini app for your company that can be published to the Base app and Farcaster. 


> Before interacting with this demo, please review our [disclaimer](#disclaimer) — there are **no official tokens or apps** associated with Cubey, Base, or Coinbase.



Before getting started, make sure you have:

* Base app account
* A [Farcaster](https://farcaster.xyz/) account
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account for hosting the application
* [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/) Client API Key



```bash
git clone https://github.com/base/demos.git
```





```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME="Your App Name"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=<Replace-WITH-YOUR-CDP-API-KEY>
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=
```



**Skip the `accountAssociation` object for now.**

To personalize your app, change the `name`, `subtitle`, and `description` fields and add images to your `/public` folder. Then update their URLs in the file.


```bash
vercel --prod
```

You should have a URL deployed to a domain similar to: `https://your-vercel-project-name.vercel.app/`

### 2. Update environment variables

Add your production URL to your local `.env` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME="Your App Name"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=<Replace-WITH-YOUR-CDP-API-KEY>
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-vercel-project-name.vercel.app/
```

### 3. Upload environment variables to Vercel

Add environment variables to your production environment:

```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_URL production
```

## Account Association

### 1. Sign Your Manifest

1. Navigate to [Farcaster Manifest tool](https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/manifest)
2. Paste your domain in the form field (ex: your-vercel-project-name.vercel.app)
3. Click the `Generate account association` button and follow the on-screen instructions for signing with your Farcaster wallet
4. Copy the `accountAssociation` object

### 2. Update Configuration

Update your `minikit.config.ts` file to include the `accountAssociation` object:

```ts
export const minikitConfig = {
    accountAssociation: {
        "header": "your-header-here",
        "payload": "your-payload-here",
        "signature": "your-signature-here"
    },
    frame: {
        // ... rest of your frame configuration
    },
}
```



## Testing and Publishing
